## Privacy Policy

The SUMARiS App uses the user's device for:

- Uploading pictures, such as the user's profile avatar or pictures of fish specimens;
- Uploading videos (coming soon);
- Uploading locations, such as fishing operation positions;
- Monitoring the network status to warn the user when the network is lost.

### Pictures

Privacy policies are as follows:

- Specimen pictures are stored locally but can be uploaded to the [SUMARiS Pod](https://github.com/sumaris-net/sumaris-pod/) if the user decides to export them.
  > Specimen pictures can be added from the following app screens:
  > - Fishing operation form (`Menu > Trips > select a trip > select an operation > open the second or third tab > open a species batch`);
  > - Landing form (`Menu > Occasion > select an occasion > select a landing or a vessel > open the second tab > open a species batch`).
      > Pictures can be enabled or disabled, depending on the selected data collection programs.
- Profile avatars are public data, stored by the [SUMARiS Pod](https://github.com/sumaris-net/sumaris-pod/).
  - NOTE: This feature is not yet implemented. For now, the app uses avatars from the Gravatar website if available. Users cannot define their own avatar.
  - You can completely remove your profile avatar:
    - Using the account page.
    - By filling out the delete account request form: https://forms.gle/tVT3uruhrDMrZFkv5.

### Videos

Privacy policies are as follows:

- Videos are stored locally but can be uploaded to the [SUMARiS Pod](https://github.com/sumaris-net/sumaris-pod/) if the user decides to export them.

> NOTE: This feature is not yet implemented. For now, only pictures can be used.

### Positions

Privacy policies are as follows:

- Vessel positions are stored locally, then used and uploaded to the [SUMARiS Pod](https://github.com/sumaris-net/sumaris-pod/) if the user decides to input the latitude/longitude from the fishing operation screen.
  > Vessel positions can be added from the following app screens:
  > - Fishing operation form (`Menu > Trips > select a trip > select an operation`).
- **Only when the user is connected to the **Seychelles Fisheries Authorities** (SFA Pod - https://sih.sfa.sc):**
  - These positions are stored locally (one position every 30 minutes) and then uploaded to the [SFA Pod](https://sih.sfa.sc) when the user clicks on "Terminate" from an occasion form (`Menu > Occasion > bottom button 'Terminate' `).
  - To delete all collected positions, please contact the [SFA Pod administrator](https://sfa.sc/contact/).

### Network Status

Privacy policies are as follows:

- When the app starts, it monitors the network status. A warning is displayed when the network is lost.
- No data is stored or uploaded, either locally or anywhere else.
